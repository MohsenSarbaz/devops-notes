# Docker Simplified – Beginner Guide

This repository contains a PDF document titled **Docker Simplified: An Introductory Guide for Beginners**.

I created this guide for people who are new to Docker and want to understand the basics of containerization in a simple and practical way.

## What This Document Covers

In this PDF, I explain:

- What Docker is and why it is used
- The idea of containers and how they work
- Basic Docker concepts such as images and containers
- Simple examples to help you get started with Docker

The focus is on **clear explanations**, not complex theory.

## Learning Style

To make learning easier, I used:
- Images
- Diagrams
- Visual examples

These visuals come from public educational sources in the Docker community and are included only to help explain the concepts better.

## Who This Is For

This guide is suitable for:
- Beginners learning Docker
- DevOps and cloud learners
- Software engineers starting with containers

If you have any feedback, questions, or suggestions, feel free to contact me or open an issue.  
I’m always happy to improve this guide.

Happy learning 🚀
