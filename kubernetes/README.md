## About the PDF Guide

I wrote the **Kubernetes Simplified** PDF for people who are new to Kubernetes and want a clear, high-level understanding without getting lost in complex details.

The document explains:
- What Kubernetes is
- Why it is used
- Core components and basic concepts
- How Kubernetes manages containers

Some diagrams and images are taken from public educational sources and are used only for learning purposes.

The installation guide is a **practical, hands-on walkthrough** that shows:

This file is useful after reading the PDF, when you want to **apply the concepts in practice**.
